drughelper is an R package to identify and correct some drug names of the user's interest in order to easily work with them. drughelper is constantly updating its dataset (once a month) from Chembl's database. 

## drughelper functionality

Drughelper has been created to be as interactive as possible, only one function is needed to get the main information of the input drugs. Also, a vector with the name or synonyms of required drugs is needed as an argument to the function:  

```{r}
vectorofdrugs <- c("Cyclosporin A", "Bacitracin")

drughelper::checkDrugSynonym(vectorofdrugs)

```
